### Dynamic Programming 
<p>
ðŸ§ The code imports libraries and reads data from CSV files into DataFrames<br>
ðŸ§ The maximize_attractions function finds the maximum number of attractions that can be visited within a budget<br>
ðŸ§ It uses a 2D table called dp to store the maximum attractions for each state (city and budget combination)<br>
ðŸ§ The function iterates over cities and budgets, filling the dp table based on whether to visit the current attraction or skip it<br>
ðŸ§ Backtracking is used to find the selected attractions based on the filled dp table<br>
ðŸ§ The get_recommendations function uses the maximize_attractions function to get recommended cities based on user input<br>
ðŸ§ User inputs their name, budget, and the number of cities they want to visit<br>
ðŸ§ The get_recommendations function is called with user input, and recommended cities are stored<br>
ðŸ§ The recommended cities and the merged DataFrame are printed</p>

## Mini Projects
The mini-projects folder contains four Python mini-projects:

### 1. Email Sender.py
This program allows you to send emails using Python's built-in smtplib module. You can specify the recipient's email address, subject, and message.

### 2. Email Slicer.py
This program allows you to slice an email address into its username and domain name.

### 3. Word Replacement.py
This program allows you to replace specific words in a text file. You can specify the input file, output file, and the words you want to replace.

### 4. Fortune Cookies.py
This program displays random fortunes.

## Snake Game

### How to Play
Use the following keys to move the snake:

W - Up
S - Down
A - Left
D - Right
The objective of the game is to eat the food (colored shapes) that appear on the screen and grow as long as possible without colliding with the walls or your own body.

### Features
Randomly generated food colors and shapes
Keeps track of score and high score
Game resets when the snake collides with a wall or its own body
The speed of the snake increases as the score increases
Dependencies
This game requires the turtle module, which is included in the standard library of Python.

### Installation
Clone this repository or download the ZIP file and extract the contents to a directory of your choice.

### Running the Game
Navigate to the directory containing the game files and run the following command:
```python
python snake.py
```

## Tic Tac Toe
âœ¨The normal game you know under discribtion of:
âœ¨Build a command-line Tic Tac Toe game using Python without a GUI.
âœ¨Implement game logic using Python's built-in data structures and control flow.
âœ¨Players input their moves as text in the command line.
âœ¨The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
âœ¨Initialize the game board as a 3x3 list of lists, with each element representing a square on the board, initially set to an empty string.
âœ¨Create a function to print the current game board to the console using loops to iterate through rows and columns.
âœ¨Develop a function to handle player moves:
âœ¨Accept the game board and the current player's symbol as parameters.
âœ¨Use input() to prompt the player for their move.
âœ¨Update the game board with the player's symbol in the chosen square.
âœ¨Create a function to check for a win:
âœ¨Accept the game board and the current player's symbol as parameters.
âœ¨Check rows, columns, and diagonals for three matching symbols in a row.
âœ¨Implement a function to check for a tie:
âœ¨Accept the game board as a parameter.
âœ¨Verify if all squares on the board are filled.
âœ¨Set up the main game loop:
âœ¨Alternate between players in each iteration.
âœ¨Display the current game board and prompt the current player for their move.
âœ¨Update the game board and check for a win or tie condition.
âœ¨If met, end the loop and display the appropriate message.

###  Automated EDA
* Develop an Automated EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) tool using Python.
* The tool simplifies EDA by automating data preprocessing and visualization.
* Supports various data formats: CSV, Excel, and SQL databases.
* Identifies column data types and performs appropriate preprocessing steps.
* Preprocessing includes handling missing values, encoding categories, scaling numerical features, etc.
* Provides options for feature selection and dimensionality reduction.
* Focuses on facilitating analysis of large datasets.
* Generates comprehensive visualization dashboards for each column type.
* Visualization types include histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and more.
* Utilizes Python libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for interactive visualizations.
* Offers user-friendly command-line interface.
* Involves stages of designing, implementing, testing, and debugging.
* Aim is to ensure the functionality and effectiveness of the tool.

## How to Use
To use these projects, simply clone the repository to your local machine and run the Python files using your favorite Python IDE or the command line. For the Snake Game, make sure you have the Pygame library installed on your machine.
